<title>Usman's Sump Pump Water Level Monitoring system</title>
<h3> The plot above was a real-time data taken from an ultra-sonic sensor to measure the sump water level in my basement.</h3>

Up-to-date implementations:
<li> Measure water depth using an ultra-sonic sensor and Arduino UNO microcontroller.
<li> Write the data into a file in the SD card memory of the ethernet card.
<li> Upload the file using FTP to my personal frontier.com website. 
I guess I am too cheap to pay for a subscription to a web hosting with PHP. 
Having PHP website would've been easier to implement.
<li> Use Java-Script to plot the data (plot above).
<li> Send the data to another Arduino microcontroller wirelessly via Xbee. 
The 2nd microcontroller will be placed upstairs.
<li> Both controllers, in the sump and upstairs, will be powered by batteries
just in case of power outage.

<h3>The transmitter unit, it sends wirelessly the water depth from the ultrasonic sensor to the receiver unit. It also updates the plot above on real-time via the internet.</h3>
